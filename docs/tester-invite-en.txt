Hi,

You are invited to test Events on Google Play (Closed Testing track).

What to test:
1. Organizer onboarding and event creation (free + paid)
2. Participant search and registration flow
3. Payment simulation / payment status transitions
4. CSV export and dashboard updates

Please report bugs with:
- device model
- Android version
- steps to reproduce
- screenshot/video if possible

Thank you.
